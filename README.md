# Node.js wpautop()
Node.js port of Wordpress' wpautop() function based on the sourcecode at http://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/src/wp-includes/formatting.php

Uses phpjs rather than attempting a full port, mainly for lazyness.

Also contains ports of the test suite from http://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/tests/phpunit/tests/formatting/Autop.php

"Hilarious" toilet humour copied verbatim from the WordPress sourcecode. No attempt has been made to clean the function up or make it "better". This is a rough and ready port, warts and all.

Thanks goes to @stewiem2000 for emotional support during regular expression meltdowns.
